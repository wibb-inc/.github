# Security policy
We want to keep Wibb safe for everyone.


## Program Rules
Maintaining effective security is a community effort. To recognize the effort and the important role it's played in keeping Wibb safe for everyone, we offer a bounty for reporting certain qualifying security vulnerabilities. Please make sure you review the following program rules before you report a vulnerability. By participating in this program, you agree to be bound by these rules.

### Security Issues?
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on any of the Wibb software, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. 

Please report sensitive security issues via Wibb's bug-bounty program (https://hackerone.com/wibb) rather than GitHub. We'll work with you to make sure that we understand the issue. We consider security reports our highest priority.
